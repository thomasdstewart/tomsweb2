I have a Barclaycard credit card and a Halifax credit card. I recently decided
to experiment to try to find out how much it costs to use them abroad to withdraw
cash from an ATM. I might be crazy, but I wanted to know! Both cards have
particular offers that mean you don't get charged as much as most cards do to
withdraw cash. I did a cash withdrawal of €50 from an ATM on both cards on the
same day. Anyway, on with the results:

| Card                 | Money Withdrawn | Cost on Bill                             | Overall Rate | Historical rate from ex.com | Historical rate from issuer | Rate difference |
| -------------------- | --------------- | ---------------------------------------- | ------------ | --------------------------- | --------------------------- | --------------- |
| Barclaycard (Visa)   | €50             | £42.37 (including £1.23 transaction fee) | 1.1801       | 1.2177                      | 1.2225                      | -0.0424         |
| Halifax (Mastercard) | €50             | £40.95                                   | 1.2210       | 1.2177                      | 1.2251                      | -0.0041         |

As I expected, my Halifax card was better!
