Since Christmas I have been up to loads. I went skiing in March and I went to
Cuba in June. I have done well with resolutions, I managed to stay super healthy
for January and managed to mostly keep to it since. However I utterly failed to
read LWN :-(

I did however keep up the reading and by my standards I have read loads! So far
I have read:

- Guards! Guards! - Terry Pratchett
- Blow Fly - Patricia Cornwell
- Twilight - Stephenie Meyer
- Starship Troopers - Robert A. Heinlein
- Altered Carbon - Richard K. Morgan
- Broken Angels - Richard K. Morgan
- New Moon - Stephenie Meyer

I'm currently reading The Magicians - Lev Grossman. I'm also almost finished the
backlog of books everyone suggested after Christmas, so any recommendations are
most welcome!
