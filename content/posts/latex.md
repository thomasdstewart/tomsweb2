Every so often I find myself recommending LaTeX to people that are either
starting a PhD or are struggling with writing their thesis up in Microsoft Word.
Over the years I found myself rewriting and improving the same email explaining
what LaTeX is and why you should use it. I've decided to just publish it and
email people a link instead.

As you probably know
[Microsoft Word](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Word) (and
[OpenOffice](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenOffice)) can be extremely
frustrating at times. There is an alternative called LaTeX, it is a different
sort of word processor, initially it seems very odd but after you get over the
initial change in mindset, you will wonder how you used Word at all to create
documents of more than 10 pages. The main advantage is that you just do the
writing, then later it makes it pretty for you. This means that while you are
writing you don't waste your time with formatting. It does all the formatting
for you as well as creating the table of contents, list of figures, page
numbers, etc. It is also totally free. I have a few links for you to peruse at
your leisure. Don't be intimidated; it's a lot easier than it looks.

A very short page about what it is:
http://scottmcpeak.com/latex/whatislatex.html and why to use it:
http://latexforhumans.wordpress.com/2008/10/07/why-use-latex/

A short write up about it: http://www.osnews.com/story/10766 and some pros and
cons: http://openwetware.org/wiki/Word_vs._LaTeX

Reasons to use it if you're a typesetting geek:
http://nitens.org/taraborelli/latex and the detailed Wikipedia page about it:

The main program for LaTeX on Windows is called MiKTeX, you can get it here:
http://miktex.org/

Next you need an editor to edit the files, there are loads out there. Notepad
will do, my favourite is [Vim](http://www.vim.org/), but there are other ones
with useful, helpful and cool features.

Then you will need a thesis template that looks good. My brother recommends:
http://www.sunilpatel.co.uk/thesis-template/. The information about this
template is actually formatted in the form of a thesis, it gives information
about LaTeX in general and information about that template. To see what that
template looks like have a look at:
http://www.sunilpatel.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/Thesis-Template-Help.pdf

My favourite guide to learn LaTeX is the "A (Not So) Short Introduction to
!LaTeX2e" which is here: http://tobi.oetiker.ch/lshort/lshort.pdf

I did a very quick search for LaTeX and EndNote and there seems to be ways to
use EndNote in LaTeX. (http://www.rhizobia.co.nz/latex/convert,
http://www.academicproductivity.com/2008/using-endnote-with-latex/). There also
seems to be Reference Manager integration too. If you don't like them or don't
like !EndNote or want to maintain some sanity then use http://www.mendeley.com/

What about supervisors making corrections? They will still want to continue
torturing themselves with Microsoft Word, just use
http://latex2rtf.sourceforge.net/ to convert your LaTeX document to RTF (which
works in Word). Then supervisors can correct with track changes to their hearts
content and you can update your original LaTeX document.

Here is a
[real example](https://ore.exeter.ac.uk/repository/bitstream/handle/10036/3102/StewartC.pdf?sequence=1)

Give it at least a try, it could save you hours in the long run. I used it for
my final year write up and my brother used it for his PhD thesis. As do many
thousands of other people. Let me know how you get on or if you need any help
with it. Google is your friend. :-)
