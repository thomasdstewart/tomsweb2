[Firefox](http://www.mozilla.com/firefox/) is an amazing browser, sometimes I
think I would not browse as much as I do if it were not around. Here is my
[user.js](user.js) which has taken many years to perfect.

I maintain a small list of essential add-ons for it:

- [Flashblock](https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/433/)
- [UnMHT](https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/8051)
- [FireGestures](https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/6366)
- [AutoAuth](https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/4949)
- [Adblock Plus](https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/1865)
- [Firebug](https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/1843)
- [Greasemonkey](https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/748)
- [It's All Text!](https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/4125)
- [JavaScript Debugger](https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/216n)
