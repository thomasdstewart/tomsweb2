[Rsync](http://samba.anu.edu.au/rsync/) is ace. It's also available for Windows
as part of the Cygwin distro. Every time I need it I have to do a token Cygwin
install, install rsync, copy out the various rsync files and remove the Cygwin
install. Here, mostly for my pleasure, is a very out of date zip with just the
rsync files in!
