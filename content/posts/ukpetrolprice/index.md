I recently repeated some analysis on the UK Petrol Prices. Slightly different
from last time, instead of a large hand-written Excel workbook, I wrote a Python
script that downloads and processes the data and creates charts from it. This
also plugs into GitLab's CI/CD functionality and, by making use of Hugo,
creates a sort of dynamically updating page of charts. This is hosted over on my
GitLab pages: https://thomasdstewart.gitlab.io/ukpetrolprice/
