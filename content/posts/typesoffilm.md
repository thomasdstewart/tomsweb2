There are only four types of film! For a while I (and possibly others) have been
able to categorise all films into four different types. I can't imagine coming
up with such an idea. Perhaps I read it somewhere, or read it in relation
stories and writing in general. However no one I have spoken to has heard of it
and I've not been able to find out much about it. The classic example is the
original Star Wars trilogy, A New Hope is "into and out of hole", Empire is
"into hole" and Jedi is "out of hole".

## into and out of hole

Nearly all films fit in this category. The film starts, everything is happy and
then something bad happens. Later on the people overcome the issue
and the film ends.

## into hole

This is the next most common category, these films can be quite depressing. The
film starts, everything is generally fine and then it just gets worse for the
people and the film ends. A very good example of this is Requiem for a Dream.

## out of hole

These are even rarer than the above. Everything starts out bad and when the film
ends everything is fine.

## no hole or hole

The last type completes the pattern and arguably is two types combined. However
I don't think this matters as this type is extremely rare. In essence nothing
bad or good happens which will mean the film is probably rubbish.
