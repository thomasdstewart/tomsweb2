TL;DR - Buy Super Unleaded petrol! (or don't)

I usually buy my petrol from Tesco for my Celica, I mostly use their super
unleaded 99 octane. I have tried both the normal and the super, I've not really
noticed a massive difference, however the super feels better, but that could
just be me imagining it. So I decided to do a not particularly scientific experiment
to find out which one really is best. Is that extra 5p per litre worth it? I get
petrol every week and a half or so and fill my 50 litre tank, so that's about
[£85](http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=%2850+litres+*+%28%C2%A30.05+%2F+litre%29%29+*+%2852+weeks+%2F+1.5%29)
difference.

My Celica does not have mileage readout so I had to calculate it the old
fashioned way. Which is: get the tank almost empty, fill it to the brim, take
note of the odometer reading, drive until the tank is almost empty, fill it
again to the brim and take note of the odometer reading again. That way the
petrol sloshing about in the bottom of the tank is not counted. The odometer
difference is the total distance and the amount filled the second time is the
fuel volume. I did this twice, once with regular and once with super. Between
each test I did a complete fill to make sure each test only had the fuel of that
test.

On with the results:

| Fuel Type | Miles    | Litres  | Paid    | Cost per Litre | Mileage                                                                        | Pounds per mile                                                                                                        |
| --------- | -------- | ------- | ------- | -------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Regular   | 334.5 mi | 52.09 l | £ 69.23 | £ 1.329        | [29.19 mpg](http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=334.5+Miles+%2F+52.09+Litres) | [4.832 mi / £](http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=%28334.5+Miles+%2F+52.09+Litres%29+%2F+%281.329+%C2%A3%2Flitre%29) |
| Super     | 333.3 mi | 50.01 l | £ 68.96 | £ 1.379        | [30.30 mpg](http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=333.3+Miles+%2F+50.01+Litres) | [4.833 mi / £](http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=%28333.3+Miles+%2F+50.01+Litres%29+%2F+%281.379+%C2%A3%2Flitre%29) |

So as you can see the numbers are all very similar, the Super is 1 mpg better
but as it costs a little more it actually works out the same! So I'm going to
stick with super which feels better and gets me an extra 15 miles per tank.
