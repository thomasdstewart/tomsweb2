I learned over the years to read the old ide subsystem errors for Linux and
generally am able to get a feel for the sort of hardware error that's coming.
However I have yet to really get a feel for the libata errors, I'm not really
used to reading the errors. A friend linked me to a page on the
[libata wiki](http://ata.wiki.kernel.org/index.php/Libata_error_messages).
