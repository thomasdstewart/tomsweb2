## Method

- Pick rhubarb, wash and cut into 1-2cm chunks place in container (20:00
  21/07/2021 after cutting 3.348 kg)
- Add sugar at a 5:3 rhubarb:sugar ratio (21:00 21/07/2021 2.009 kg of sugar was
  added, mixed and left to stand)
- Wait for 36-48 hours (13:30 23/07/2021 all sugar dissolved)
- Filter into demijohn (2.4L therefore ~0.4L rhubarb juice)
- Use two teabags in a jug, add 300ml of boiling water, brew for 5 min, remove
  bags and top to 300ml add to demijohn
- Add 10 grams of raisins
- Add one heaped teaspoon of yeast into 5L demijohn
- Add water at a ~1:1.2 rhubarb:water ratio to fill 5L demijohn (2.5L so more
  like 1:0.75?)
- Take some liquid and read with hydrometer (60)

Racked on 31st July, g read 0.988, eg (1.060-0.988)\*131 = 9.4% abv

All but stopped growth by 3rd Aug; added 200ml and one teaspoon of sugar to the demijohn on 5th
Racked on

## Calculations

A hydrometer measures the density of a liquid, water is 1.0. Lots of dissolved
sugar is more dense, so would read higher eg 1.1, the hydrometer floats lower.
Once sugar is converted to alcohol it reads lower as a water alcohol solution is
less dense than water, and thus the hydrometer floats higher

(final gravity 'FG' - original gravity 'OG') \* 131.25 = ABV%
