I go to spinning quite a bit and I think I have had six teachers over the last
year since I started. I think every teacher has one phrase they use most; this
is not a bad thing, it's just something I have noticed. I present an anonymous list
of them here.

- butts over the saddles
- quarter turn
- begin with the end in mind
- go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go
- thumbs on the ends of the handlebars
