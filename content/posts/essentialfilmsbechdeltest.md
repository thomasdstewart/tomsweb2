I recently found out about the
[Bechdel Test](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bechdel_Test), I was interested in
how many of my [Essential Films]({{< relref "essentialfilms.md" >}}) passed the
test. So I used the [Bechdel Test Movie List](http://bechdeltest.com/) to
cross-reference. I did some horrible HTML dumps and scripting to do this; after
I finished I found out that they provide an
[API](http://bechdeltest.com/api/v1/doc) that can search based on IMDb ID. I
currently have 79 films in my list; 64 have ratings listed, or 81% of them.
