I played with Fedora more today. There are loads of packages in the default
repos these days. However I still find myself missing things from Debian. For
example, I can't do a "yum search" while doing a "yum upgrade". Why? I also miss
the small helper scripts that save on legwork. For example update-grub: in
Debian when a new kernel gets installed the initrd and grub get updated and it
just works. With Fedora I have to manually update the grub config and if I
forget to create the initrd, it means a trip to the 13 PCs I just upgraded!
