I got back on Monday night after cutting it worryingly close to get to the
airport; two hours in advance, try 40 min! Only for Ryanair to delay the flight by
an hour and tell no one. Then there's the Post Holiday Blues, aka
[PTD](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Post_vacation_blues). It hit bad on Tuesday
night but I think I'm used to the grindstone again now.

Also I'm not laughing now:

```
$ psql -c "select count(*) from rssr.entries where read = false;" rssr
 count
 -------
   9941
   (1 row)

$
```

In other news I might be going to see "STOCKWELL: THE INQUEST" in the Landor
Theatre on Monday night. My post holiday resolution is to go to London for more
culture.
