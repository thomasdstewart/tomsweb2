So my [gym](http://www.hertssportsvillage.co.uk/) is closed for 10 days for a
refurbishment. They are going to replace all the cardio equipment with new kit.
I'll be able to check my progress online and I'll be able to plug in a video
iPod and watch on the screen. The problem is, while it's closed I have no gym to
go to! So I decided to try some classes instead. Tonight I tried a yoga class
and it was great - both relaxing and tiring at the same time. I really enjoyed it
and think I'll be going more often in the future; hopefully it will help improve
my skiing.
