Whenever I buy coffee I usually get a small or a medium. Up to now I've always
seemed to enjoy the small ones more. I've always assumed it was because a medium
was too much of a good thing, which has led me to hardly ever get a large.

However I was thinking recently that maybe I was wrong and the small ones just
taste better. This led me to wonder why. Anyone that knows me knows that I love
milk. I thought that maybe I liked more milky ones better. I decided to conduct
an experiment; over a few days I got a small, medium and large coffee to measure
how much milk will fit in each one.

I didn't bother measuring the volume of the paper cups I just read the volume
from some text on the bottom of the Starbucks cups, assumed each shot was 30ml
and I also did not take into account milk foam or dead space at the top of the
cup. Anyway here are the results:

| Cup Size | Cup Volume (ml) | Shots | Coffee Volume (ml) | Total Milk (ml) | Milk to Coffee Ratio |
| -------- | --------------- | ----- | ------------------ | --------------- | -------------------- |
| Large    | 605.8           | 3     | 3\*30=90           | 605.8-90=515.8  | 515.8/90=5.73        |
| Medium   | 473             | 2     | 2\*30=60           | 473-60=413      | 413/60=6.88          |
| Small    | 355             | 1     | 1\*30=30ml         | 355-30=325      | 325/30=10.83         |

I can now conclusively state that the milk to coffee ratio is highest for small
cups, almost double that of the medium and large. Whereas large and medium are
relatively similar. Further investigation will be required to measure the cups
and shot sizes more accurately. As well as real mugs rather than paper ones. As
a side note, getting a medium with one shot will result in a milk to coffee ratio
of around 15, which could even be too milky for me! However a large with two
shots comes in around at 9 which is similar to the small ratio.

From now on I will just get smalls and if I want more I'll just buy two cups!
