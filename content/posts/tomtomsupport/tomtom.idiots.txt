OK, here is the full story. I bought a HTC P3300 a few years ago which had 
TomTom Navigator 6 bundled with it pre-installed. It was first real experience 
of TomTom and overall it became a vital to have it's capabilities at hand 24x7 
on and off the road. However the P3300 has grown old (and warn out) so I 
replaced it last month with a HTC Touch HD. This phone does not come with 
TomTom pre-installed. So I tried to install TomTom Navigator 6 but 
unfortunately it did not work. I assume it's because of the screen size and 
after a few internet searches found many other people were having the same 
problems. Most of them said that TomTom Navigator 7 fixed these issues, so I 
decided to bite the bullet and re-buy the software I already owned. However I 
could not find anywhere on your website to actually buy the mythical Navigator 
7 product! After a good deal of searching I found that that you don't actually 
sell it, you only ship it pre-installed on some HTC Touch Diamond's. Which left 
me a bit stuck with a nasty taste in my mouth. However I do not give up that 
easily, I 'found' a Navigator 7 installer that had been created by extracting 
the Touch Diamonds software. This I installed and finally I had a working 
device again.

It was at this point that I tried to update TomTom traffic and TomTom safety 
cameras at which point it gave me a message "This content was bought for 
another device". This it why I want to change the device ID for my 
subscriptions.

As a side note you mention "there can only be one TomTom device linked to your 
TomTom account at any one time", it seems a bit silly that you never expect one 
person to buy more than one TomTom device? But back to you point, I fully 
understand the above, I don't want my old P3300 to be associated with my 
account anymore. TomTom is not even installed on it.

The reason I mention all of the above is to explain why I don't have a 
"purchase receipt" to either fax or email. As I have never been given one. So 
where do we go from here?

Dear Mr Stewart,

Thank you for contacting TomTom Customer Care
The reference number for your query is 090424-003803.

Unfortunately, if you did not get your copy of Navigator 7 preinstalled on a 
phone then you are using an illegally copied version of our software. As a 
TomTom representative, I have to ask you to remove this software from your 
device. For your information, none of our maps or services will work with this 
illegal version of software you have.

If you can provide me with a proof of purchase for your new phone I will reset 
the device code on your account, allowing you to install Navigator 6 on your 
new device.

Please let me know if you require any further assistance.

With Kind Regards

Matt D

1. I can't provide proof of purchase, both phones were mobile phone upgrades. I 
did not buy them.

2. The device code has nothing to do with installing TomTom, this is about 
un-associating my old phone with my TomTom online account.

3. Even if I did provide proof of purchase, how is installing Navigator 6 on my 
new phone going to help me. It does not work remember?

Dear Mr Stewart,

Thank you for contacting TomTom Customer Care in regards to the RDS TMC receiver
The reference number for your query is 090424-003803.

If you have any issues with receiving traffic updates with your RDS TMC traffic 
receiver, or that the TMC receiver is not recognized by your device, then 
please do the following:-

STEP 1 Install the latest version of TomTom Home

If you haven't already done so, please download and Install the latest version 
of TomTom Home from http://www.tomtom.com/home

STEP 2 Make a Backup

- Connect your TomTom to your computer and switch it on
- On a PC, create a new folder on your desktop and call it 'Backup'

- On a PC, Open 'My Computer', you will see the TomTom as a removable storage 
device, e.g. TomTom (E:), double left click into it.
- Click on Edit -> Select All, then click on 'Edit -> Copy'
- Go to your Backup folder on your desktop that you have created, double left 
click into it and click on 'Edit -> Paste'

IMPORTANT: We advise you to follow the next steps ONLY if you have made a 
successful backup of your device as described in Step 2. If you are unable to 
complete step 2, please reply back to this email and let us know what happens.

STEP 3 Delete the Application Files

- Open My Computer in Windows; you will see the TomTom as a removable disk. 
Double click into it.
- You will see a list of yellow folders and a list of loose files
- Delete all of the loose files and the GNS folder. (Loose files are the files 
that are not Yellow Folders)
 **IMPORTANT**: Any of the other YELLOW folders with their content must NOT be 
deleted.

STEP 4 - Now we need to delete the application files from your PC so that HOME 
will offer them as an update

\225 Now on your Computer, in the system tray, (in the bottom right hand corner 
by the time, there is a little red TomTom HOME logo, if its not there, click    
 on the little arrow pointing towards left to show all the hidden icons).  
Right click on the TomTom logo and select exit.
\225 Click on Start in the bottom left of your PC
\225 Now select My documents -> TomTom -> HOME -> Downloads -> Complete
\225 Please delete the yellow Program folder.

STEP 5 - Update your device

\225 Reset the TomTom with a paperclip for 30 seconds.
\225 Connect your device to the PC and turn it on.
\225 Open TomTom HOME: Start->All Programs->TomTom->TomTom HOME 2.
\225 HOME will now load your updates (If this does not happen automatically, 
click on Update My ONE/GO/Rider on the main menu of HOME.)
\225 Make sure that only the application is marked with a green tick.
\225 Click on Update and Install.
\225 Once Installed, click on done.
\225 You will now be prompted by HOME to restart your Device, just click ok.
\225 In the Top left of HOME, click on 'Device -> Disconnect Device'.
\225 Now please disconnect your TomTom from the computer and allow it to start 
up normally.

If you get \223No Maps Found\224 on your TomTom, please repeat Step 5 until the 
application is no longer offered as an update.

STEP 6 Run the Clear Flash Tool

- Reconnect the TomTom to the computer and switch it on
- Close TomTom HOME. In the bottom right hand corner of your screen, to the 
left of the computer clock, right click on the red icon for TomTom Home and 
choose 'Exit'.
- Click on http://www.tomtom.com/updates/clear_flash/clear_flash.exe to run the 
clear flash tool.
(TomTom Home must be completely closed before running this tool)
- Install the Clear Flash tool
- Disconnect your TomTom from the Computer

STEP 7 Connect your TMC Receiver

- In your Car, lay out the RDS TMC Receiver in a straight line across your 
dashboard
- Switch your TomTom on
- Connect the TMC receiver to your device and make sure that the receiver is 
firmly plugged in. You might need to press a little bit harder to make sure.
- You should see on the screen of the TomTom a message to say that the RDS TMC 
receiver has been connected.
- If not, try rotating the Plug of the TMC receiver connected to the unit by 
1/4 turns, and see if the screen shows this message.

Please also check to see if the RDS TMC socket is not damaged in anyway and 
also if there the black 'O' Ring is not missing in the socket where you connect 
the RDS TMC receiver.

Please let us know if this has worked for you. If not, to help us verify that 
you have the correct RDS TMC receiver for your device, can you please confirm 
your TMC Receiver's article code and the Serial number for your TomTom product?

The article code can be found on a white label on the cable of the TMC 
Receiver, it usually begins with 4V00.XXX. Please state if the RDS TMC receiver 
came 'inside the box' or whether it was bought separately.

The Serial Number for your device can be found on the base of the TomTom device 
by the barcode, and also, you can find it on the original box of your product.

If you have any more questions, please let me know and I will be more than 
happy to help you further.

With Kind Regards

RDS traffic has nothing whatsoever to do with my original question. I don't
even own a TMC receiver. I use TomTom Navigator, so my Phone that runs TomTom
Navigator will not have a TomTom serial number.

Please can you address the questions in my previous question:
1. I can't provide proof of purchase, both phones were mobile phone upgrades. I
did not buy them.

2. The device code has nothing to do with installing TomTom, this is about
un-associating my old phone with my TomTom online account.

3. Even if I did provide proof of purchase, how is installing Navigator 6 on my
new phone going to help me. It does not work, remember only Navigator 7 works?

Please do not just copy and paste another canned reply.

Again, how is the "System Information" going to help with the previous 
questions?

I said "Please do not just copy and paste another canned reply". These canned 
messages are getting increasingly annoying. Especially as they have nothing 
whatsoever to do the the actual problem.
