## Serial Console Cables

It's common for some devices to not have a video output and some sort of
keyboard input, be it VGA/HDMI and PS2 or USB. Instead then have a serial
console. A [console](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/System_console) console being
the primary way to interact with the device. This is especially common in
servers and network devices.

An advantage to this is that it's a common technology that works out-of-band and
thus you can interact with the system without any networking. The disadvantage
is there are many different standards at play which make it rather frustrating
to test, esp when working with unknown kit.
