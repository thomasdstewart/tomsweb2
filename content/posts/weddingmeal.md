I went to Tony and Grainne's wedding on Friday. It was a lovely day and I wish
them all the best in the future.

Anyway, I learnt something while at the hotel that annoyed me: the name of the
meal at the wedding reception. Hint: it's not lunch. It's called the
[Wedding reception](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wedding_reception). I'm not
entirely sure why, but it really does get on my nerves.
