Last week I got back from a little holiday in Dublin. I went over for my cousin's
graduation. I had an amazing time, it was a very relaxed and slow paced get
away from everything. We went to all sorts of different cafes, restaurants and
live music bars in the evening. It felt so luxurious to stay in a hotel in the
centre of town, we were able to roll out of which ever bar we were in, hail a
cab and be back home in no time. Coming back to a made bed and fresh towels
can't be beaten.

A few places stood out. One night we went for a Mexican in
[Acapulca](http://www.acapulco.ie/) which was amazing in itself but it was
topped off by their "Deep Fried Ice Cream" desert. We also went to a restaurant
type cafe one day. I can't remember the name of it now, but it served the best
hot chocolate I have ever had. Then there was the
[Queen of Tarts](http://www.queenoftarts.ie/) which is a lovely little cafe with
amazing carrot cake.

We did not stay in the hotel for the whole time, the last night one of my
cousins friends put us up in their amazing house. They took us to a very strange
but also very cool place that only served tea. It was called The
[Tea Garden](http://www.tea-garden.eu/). It had one of the most relaxing
atmospheres I have been in. It was divided up into small booths with raised
floors, cushions and small tables. We took our shoes off and sat round the small
table and just relaxed! The waitress then came round and was able to recommend
which teas to try. It was cool socialising without booze. When the tea came the
pots had little night lights to keep them warm. We then just whiled the time
away chatting.

It was not all food and drink mind, we did fit in a trip to the Book of Kells.
We finished the trip off on the last day with a late afternoon visit to
Bewley's.
