This year seems to have flown by so it's resolutions time again. I've done quite
well; I managed to stay relatively healthy and read loads of books but I failed
completely to keep up to date with LWN.

Including the books from July, I've managed to read 18 books, which is ace!
Please
make recommendations.

- The Magicians - Lev Grossman
- Woken Furies - Richard K. Morgan
- A Thief of Time - Terry Pratchett
- Making Money - Terry Pratchett
- Ender's Game - Orson Scott Card
- Century Rain - Alastair Reynolds
- Terry Pratchett - Going Postal
- Total Poker - David Spanier
- The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo - Stieg Larsson
- The Girl Who Played with Fire - Stieg Larsson
- The Girl Who Kicked the Hornets' Nest - Stieg Larsson

As for this year's resolutions, it's almost going to be the same.

- Stay super healthy for January and February, except for Little Christmas and
  Skiing
  - Keeping to my minimum weekly gym schedule, 3 morning swims, 2 morning spins,
    2 afternoon spins, 2 afternoon yogas, 1-2 weekend weights and cv.
  - No snacks during the day.
  - No cake or chocolate (except for cake club).
  - Herbal tea during the day with no milk.
  - No burgers, chips or beer.
  - No getting drunk.
  - Drinking loads of water.
- Start reading LWN again.
