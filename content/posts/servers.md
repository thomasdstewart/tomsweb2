## kunzite

Kunzite was my main UML and latterly kvm virtual machine hosted by Bytemark,
they are an amazing company, and I highly recommend them! It was long lived,
kunzite was first installed on 18th October 2005 with 80Meg ram with 4GB of disk
and it finished with 488Meg ram and 20G disk. I've migrated all services to
another VM called beryl running on Bytemark's BigV.
