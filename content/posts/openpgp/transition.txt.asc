Subject: OpenPGP Transition from 1024D to 4096R

For a number of reasons[0], I've recently set up a new OpenPGP key,
and will be transitioning away from my old one.

The old key will continue to be valid for some time, but I prefer all
future correspondence to come to the new one. I would also like this
new key to be re-integrated into the web of trust. This message is
signed by both keys to certify the transition.

The old key was:
pub   1024D/68A70C48 2003-02-11 [expires: 2014-03-19]
      Key fingerprint = DCCD 7DCB A74A 3E3B 60D5  DF4C FC1D 1ECA 68A7 0C48
uid       [ultimate] Thomas Stewart <thomas@stewarts.org.uk>

And the new key is:
pub   4096R/CD617CF2 2013-03-18 [expires: 2016-03-18]
      Key fingerprint = 217D 695D ACE2 AE40 F9FE  B0C0 85C8 5556 CD61 7CF2
uid       [ultimate] Thomas Stewart <thomas@stewarts.org.uk>

To fetch the full key from a public key server, you can simply do:

  gpg --keyserver keys.riseup.net --recv-key CD617CF2

If you already know my old key, you can now verify that the new key is
signed by the old one:

  gpg --check-sigs CD617CF2

If you don't already know my old key, or you just want to be double
extra paranoid, you can check the fingerprint against the one above:

  gpg --fingerprint CD617CF2

If you are satisfied that you've got the right key, and the UIDs match
what you expect, I'd appreciate it if you would sign my key. You can
do that by issuing the following command:

  gpg --sign-key CD617CF2

I'd like to receive your signatures on my key. You can either upload
these signatures to a public keyserver directly:

  gpg --keyserver keys.riseup.net --send-key CD617CF2

Or you can send me an e-mail with the new signatures (if you have a
functional MTA on your system):

  gpg --armor --export CD617CF2 | gpg --armor --encrypt -r CD617CF2 | mail -s 'OpenPGP Signatures' thomas@stewarts.org.uk

I also highly recommend checking out the excellent Riseup GPG best
practices doc, from which I stole most of the text for this transition
message!

https://we.riseup.net/riseuplabs+paow/openpgp-best-practices

Please let me know if you have any questions, or problems, and sorry
for the inconvenience.

Kind Regards
