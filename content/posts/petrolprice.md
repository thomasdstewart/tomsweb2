Petrol prices are always on the rise. I decided to do some analysis on some raw
data comparing the price of Brent crude oil and the price of petrol. The details
of the analysis are on my site. I found out that there is a direct correlation
between the price of Brent crude oil and the price of petrol at the pump
excluding duty and VAT.

I concluded that if the price of Brent crude oil stays at $115 per barrel then
the price of petrol will increase to 136.14 +/- 3.92 pence per litre, with
petrol at around 125 at the time of the analysis.
