My Tomsweb site has been on [MoinMoin](http://moinmo.in/) for 11 years and has
served me well! However I've just migrated to a statically generated site
builder called [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/). It's stored in
[gitlab.com/thomasdstewart/tomsweb/](https://gitlab.com/thomasdstewart/tomsweb/)
and the CI/CD generates the pages and serves the content. So now I don't need to
run an Apache server anymore.
