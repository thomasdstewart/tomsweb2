It's time for some new year's resolutions! Hopefully if they are cast in stone
(well blog) there is more of a chance of success.

- Stay super healthy for January:
  - Keeping to my minimum weekly gym schedule, 3 morning swims, 2 morning spins,
    2-3 afternoon spins, 2 afternoon yogas, 1-2 weekend weights and cv.
  - No snacks during the day.
  - No cake or chocolate.
  - Herbal tea during the day with no milk.
  - No burgers, chips or beer.
  - No getting drunk.
  - Drinking loads of water.
- Read more books, not reference books, what I call story books. I think a
  realistic goal is one chapter a week. I have started with Terry Pratchett's
  "Guards! Guards!", feel free to recommend books.
- Start reading LWN again.
